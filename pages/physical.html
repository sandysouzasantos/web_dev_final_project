    <h3> It's time to move your body</h3>

    <p>It is common sense that we must keep moving our bodies. But it should be neither about calories nor unreachable
        beauty standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we putting some effort into something our main goals must be our health and personal satisfaction,
        including physical activities.
    </p>
    <p>Exercising nowadays it is not a natural thing, you need to construct the habit. But before registering yourself
        at gym, you should be aware of what type of activity fits better for you and gives you pleasure to keep going.
    </p>

            It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.

    <p>And why start at the gym?! Physical health is about being active, not necessarily going to the gym and lifting up
        some weights. Maybe you can discover an athlete yourself starting a new sport or trying something you used to
        do.
